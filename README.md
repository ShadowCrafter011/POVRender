# About
This repository provides an easy way to add a handy entry into the POV-Ray tools menu. The entry called "Render video" determines automatically the location of the last rendered animation and creates a video MP4 file of the animation using Python and moviepy. To get started read the section below

# Installation
### Make sure POV-Ray is not running before proceeding with the installation
- Download the code from Github to your computer
- Unzip the files in a directory of your choice
- Navigate to the install directory
- Run either the install.bat of the install_no_admin.bat file depending if you have access to admin privileges. If you run the install_no_admin.bat file you might have to specify the location of the POV-Ray documents directory. Usually this directory is "C:\Users\username\Documents\POV-Ray\v3.7". Replace username with the username you are currently logged in with
- Wait for the installer to finish
- Start POV-Ray
- Under the tools menu click "Render video" to render the last animation you made
